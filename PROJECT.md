# CMD List Info
Small App to list generic info about a text file


## What can it do?
It lists info such as:
- lines count
- characters count (without new-line \n)
- words count
- spaces count


## How to build it?
First locate yourself into the root dir of the project.
Then run ``gcc src/start.c -o output/start``.
In the folder ``output`` there would be a ``start.exe`` file.

## How to run it? 
First locate yourself into the folder with the ``start.exe`` file.
Enter ``./start.exe`` with a path to a text file in cmd.
So it would look like this ``./start.exe C:/Users/You/text.txt``

## Why was this project created? 
I have created this project to learn C. And my first idea was, to make a in cmd IDE. But my C skills are not so great. So I have splitted the project in parts, first part is this repo.
